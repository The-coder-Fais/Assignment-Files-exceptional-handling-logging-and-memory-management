{"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMBXqyfcfO41Ltmfc8AFls7"},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1) What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n","\n","Answer:-The fundamental difference lies in the execution model.\n","\n","In compiled languages, a program's entire source code is first translated into machine code (or a similar low-level format like bytecode) by a program called a compiler. This compilation process happens before the program is run. Once compiled, the resulting executable file can be run directly by the computer's operating system and CPU. The key advantage here is speed; since the translation is a one-time process, the program executes very quickly. Examples include C, C++, and Rust, which are often used for high-performance applications like video games and operating systems.\n","\n","In contrast, an interpreted language uses an interpreter to translate and execute the code line by line at runtime. The interpreter reads a line of source code, translates it into machine instructions, and then executes it, repeating the process for every subsequent line. This makes the execution process slower, as the translation happens every time the program is run. However, interpreted languages are typically more flexible and portable, as the same source code can be run on different platforms as long as a compatible interpreter is installed. Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are common examples.\n","\n",".2). What is exception handling in Python?\n","\n","Answer:- Exception handling is a robust mechanism for managing and responding to runtime errors, or exceptions, that interrupt the normal flow of a program. It's a way to anticipate and handle errors gracefully, rather than allowing them to cause the program to crash. Instead of a program abruptly terminating, you can \"catch\" an exception and execute specific code to manage the situation. This could involve logging the error, informing the user, or attempting to recover and continue execution. It's a cornerstone of writing reliable and resilient software.\n","\n","3) What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","\n","Answer:-The primary purpose of the finally block is to ensure that a block of code is executed no matter what. It is always run after the try and except blocks have completed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or handled. This makes it ideal for performing crucial cleanup operations, such as closing a file, releasing a lock, or closing a network connection. By placing this code in the finally block, you guarantee that resources are properly released, preventing potential memory leaks or other issues, even if an unforeseen error occurs.\n","\n","4)What is logging in Python?\n","\n","Answer:- Logging is a more sophisticated and flexible way to track events within a program than simply using print() statements. It involves recording structured messages with details like a timestamp, severity level, and contextual information about the event. The logging module in Python allows you to define different levels of importance for your messages (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, ERROR) and direct them to various destinations, such as a file, the console, or an external service. This makes logging an essential tool for debugging complex applications and for monitoring their behavior in a production environment.\n","\n","5)  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","\n","Answer:-The __del__ method, also known as the destructor, is a special method called by the Python garbage collector when an object is about to be destroyed. Its significance lies in its intended purpose of performing final cleanup tasks before the object's memory is reclaimed. This could include closing an open file handle or releasing an external resource. However, its use is generally discouraged in modern Python. Because Python's garbage collector operates unpredictably, there is no guarantee that __del__ will be called at a specific time, or even called at all, which makes it unreliable for critical resource management. The with statement is a much safer and more reliable alternative.\n","\n","6)What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n","\n","Answer:-The difference lies in the namespace management. When you use import module_name, the entire module is imported as an object. To access any function, class, or variable from that module, you must use the module's name as a prefix (e.g., math.sqrt(4)). This prevents name conflicts but requires more typing.\n","\n","In contrast, from module_name import object_name imports only the specified object directly into your current namespace. This allows you to use the object without a prefix (e.g., sqrt(4)). While this can make your code cleaner and more concise, it carries a risk of name conflicts if you import objects with the same name from different modules.\n","\n","7) How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","\n","Answer:-Python offers two main ways to handle multiple exceptions:\n","\n","Multiple except blocks: You can list a separate except block for each specific exception type you want to handle. This is useful when different exceptions require unique handling logic.\n","\n","Python\n","\n","try:\n","    # code\n","except ValueError:\n","    # Handle a value error\n","except TypeError:\n","    # Handle a type error\n","Single except block with a tuple: You can list multiple exception types in a single except block by grouping them in a tuple. This is efficient when the same error-handling code applies to all the listed exceptions.\n","\n","Python\n","\n","try:\n","    # code\n","except (ValueError, TypeError):\n","    # Handle both value and type errors with the same logic\n","8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","Answer:-The with statement's primary purpose is to provide a clean and safe way to handle resource management, especially for files. It ensures that resources are properly acquired and, most importantly, automatically released once the code block is completed. When you open a file with with open(...), Python guarantees that the file's close() method will be called automatically, even if an exception occurs within the block. This prevents file handles from being left open, which can lead to resource leaks and file corruption.\n","\n","9) What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","\n","Answer:-The key difference lies in the unit of concurrency and how they handle memory.\n","\n","Multithreading involves multiple threads of execution within a single process. These threads share the same memory space, which makes communication between them very fast. However, due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. This makes multithreading ideal for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., downloading data from the internet) where a thread can pause to wait for an I/O operation to complete, allowing other threads to run.\n","\n","Multiprocessing involves running multiple, completely separate processes, each with its own memory space. This bypasses the GIL and allows for true parallel execution on multiple CPU cores. It is therefore the better choice for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., heavy numerical computations) but has a higher overhead because inter-process communication is more complex and memory is not shared.\n","\n","10) What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","\n","Answer:-Using logging offers several key advantages over simple print() statements:\n","\n","Flexibility and Control: You can configure logging to write messages to a file, the console, or an external service. You can also easily change the level of detail by setting the log level (e.g., from INFO to DEBUG) without modifying the code.\n","\n","Structured Information: Log messages can be formatted to include valuable context, such as timestamps, module names, and line numbers, which are crucial for diagnosing problems.\n","\n","Scalability: The logging module is designed for large-scale applications. You can use multiple loggers and handlers to manage complex logging requirements in a standardized way.\n","\n","Security: You can ensure that sensitive information is not logged to a production environment by setting appropriate log levels.\n","\n","11) What is memory management in Python?\n","\n","Answer:-Memory management in Python refers to the system that handles the allocation and deallocation of memory for Python objects. Python uses a private heap to store all its objects and data structures. It employs a combination of two main techniques to automate this process:\n","\n","Reference Counting: This is the primary mechanism. Each object has a counter that tracks how many references (variables) are pointing to it. When the counter drops to zero, the object is immediately deallocated and its memory is released.\n","\n","Garbage Collection: A cyclic garbage collector periodically runs to find and deallocate objects that are part of a reference cycle—objects that reference each other but are no longer accessible from the rest of the program.\n","\n","12) What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","\n","Answer:-The process of exception handling in Python follows a structured flow:\n","\n","try block: You place the code that might raise an exception within this block. The interpreter \"tries\" to execute this code.\n","\n","except block: If an exception occurs in the try block, the interpreter stops its execution and immediately looks for a matching except block. This block contains the code to handle the specific error.\n","\n","else block (optional): This block is executed only if the code in the try block completes successfully, with no exceptions raised.\n","\n","finally block (optional): This block contains code that always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred. It's used for mandatory cleanup operations.\n","\n","13). Why is memory management important in Python?\n","Answer:- Memory management is crucial because it ensures program efficiency and stability. Without it, a program might run out of memory, leading to a crash. Python's automatic memory management system:\n","\n","Prevents Memory Leaks: It automatically reclaims memory from objects that are no longer in use, preventing the program from consuming an ever-increasing amount of memory.\n","\n","Simplifies Development: Developers don't have to manually allocate and deallocate memory, which reduces the risk of common errors like forgetting to free memory or using memory after it has been freed.\n","\n","Optimizes Performance: The garbage collector is designed to be efficient, focusing on the most likely sources of memory leaks (newly created objects and reference cycles) to minimize performance overhead.\n","\n","14) What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","\n","Answer:-The try and except blocks are the core components of exception handling.\n","\n","The try block's role is to isolate code that could raise an exception. It's the \"guarded\" part of your program where you anticipate a potential problem.\n","\n","The except block's role is to catch and handle the exception if one is raised in the try block. It defines the logic for how your program should respond to a specific error, allowing it to recover or fail gracefully.\n","\n","15) How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","Answer:-Python's garbage collection (GC) system works in two complementary ways:\n","\n","Reference Counting: This is the primary and most immediate method. When an object is created, a reference counter is initialized to one. Every time a new reference to that object is created, the counter increases. When a reference is removed, the counter decreases. When the counter reaches zero, the object is immediately deallocated.\n","\n","Generational Garbage Collector: This is a secondary, more complex mechanism designed to handle reference cycles—situations where objects reference each other but are no longer accessible from the rest of the program. The GC periodically scans for these cycles and deallocates them. It's optimized by dividing objects into three \"generations\" (0, 1, and 2), with younger generations being checked more frequently, which is a very efficient strategy since most objects are short-lived.\n","\n","16) What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","\n","Answer:-The purpose of the else block is to specify a block of code that should be executed only if the code in the try block completes without raising any exceptions. This allows for a clear separation of logic: the try block contains the potentially risky code, the except block handles errors, and the else block handles the \"success\" case. It is a good practice to use it to avoid placing code that doesn't belong in the try block.\n","\n","17) What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","\n","Answer:-Python's logging module provides a standard set of logging levels to categorize messages by their severity. From least to most severe, they are:\n","\n","DEBUG: Detailed diagnostic information, useful for debugging.\n","\n","INFO: A confirmation that things are working as expected.\n","\n","WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, but the program can continue.\n","\n","ERROR: A more serious problem has occurred; the program was unable to perform a function.\n","\n","CRITICAL: A very serious error that indicates the program may be unable to continue running.\n","\n","18) What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n","Answer:-The main difference is their level of abstraction and portability.\n","\n","os.fork() is a low-level function that creates a new process by duplicating the existing one. It is a direct interface to a system call and is only available on Unix-like operating systems. Using os.fork() requires manual management of processes and communication, which can be complex.\n","\n","multiprocessing is a high-level, cross-platform module that provides a robust API for creating and managing processes. It abstracts away the complexities of os.fork() and inter-process communication, allowing developers to write portable multi-process code that works on Windows, Linux, and macOS. For most applications, multiprocessing is the recommended choice.\n","\n","19) What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","\n","Answer:-Closing a file is crucial for two main reasons:\n","\n","Resource Management: An open file consumes a limited system resource known as a file descriptor. If you don't close files, your program could run out of available file descriptors, leading to system errors or a crash.\n","\n","Data Integrity: When you write data to a file, the data is often first stored in a buffer in memory. The data is only flushed to the physical disk when the buffer is full or when the file is explicitly closed. Failing to close a file can result in lost or corrupted data.\n","\n","The with statement is the safest and most convenient way to ensure that a file is always closed, even if an exception occurs.\n","\n","20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","\n","Answer:-file.read() is used to read the entire content of a file into a single string. It can also be passed an integer argument to read a specific number of characters. This is memory-intensive for large files.\n","\n","file.readline() is used to read a file one line at a time. It reads up to the next newline character and returns the line as a string. This method is much more memory-efficient for processing large files line by line, as it doesn't need to load the entire file into memory at once.\n","\n","21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","\n","Answer:-The logging module is a powerful tool for creating a centralized and structured logging system within a Python application. Its primary use is to:\n","\n","Record events during program execution.\n","\n","Categorize events based on severity (e.g., INFO, ERROR).\n","\n","Direct log messages to different outputs, such as a file or the console.\n","\n","Filter messages based on their severity level.\n","\n","This makes it indispensable for debugging, monitoring, and diagnosing issues in production environments.\n","\n","23). What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","\n","Answer)The os module provides a bridge to the underlying operating system. In the context of file handling, it is primarily used for path manipulation and directory operations. It offers functions to:\n","\n","Create and remove directories (os.mkdir(), os.rmdir()).\n","\n","List directory contents (os.listdir()).\n","\n","Join path components in a platform-independent way (os.path.join()).\n","\n","Check file properties and existence (os.path.exists(), os.stat()).\n","\n","It complements the built-in file object functions (open(), read(), etc.), which are used to manipulate the content of a file.\n","\n","24). What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","Answer:-While Python's automatic memory management is a major convenience, it presents a few challenges for developers:\n","\n","Reference Cycles: The most significant challenge is dealing with objects that form a circular chain of references, preventing them from being collected by the primary reference counting mechanism. Python's cyclic garbage collector is designed to address this, but it adds a layer of complexity.\n","\n","Memory Leaks: These can still occur if a developer accidentally maintains a strong reference to an object that is no longer needed, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming its memory.\n","\n","Performance Overhead: The garbage collection process requires CPU time to run, which can introduce a slight, albeit often negligible, performance overhead.\n","\n","25) How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","\n","Answer;-You can manually raise an exception using the raise statement. This is a critical part of a robust program, as it allows you to signal that an error condition has been met in your code. The raise statement takes an exception object (or a class) as an argument.\n","\n","For example, if a function receives invalid input, you can raise an exception to stop its execution and inform the calling code of the error.\n","\n","Python\n","\n","def check_age(age):\n","    if age < 0:\n","        raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative.\")\n","    # The rest of the code will not run if age is negative.\n",".1F. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n","It is important to use multithreading in applications that are I/O-bound, meaning they spend most of their time waiting for external operations to complete. Examples include:\n","\n","Web scraping: waiting for web pages to download.\n","\n","Database queries: waiting for a database to return data.\n","\n","Network applications: waiting for a client request or a response from a server."],"metadata":{"id":"eCR8WcAxIHbF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Q1: Open a file for writing and write a string to it\n","with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n","    file.write(\"Hello, this is a test string.\")\n","\n","\n","# Q2: Read a file and print each line\n","with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n","    for line in file:\n","        print(line.strip())\n","\n","# Q3: Handle file not found error\n","try:\n","    with open('non_existent_file.txt', 'r') as file:\n","        content = file.read()\n","except FileNotFoundError:\n","    print(\"Error: The file does not exist.\")\n","\n","# Create a dummy source.txt file for Q4\n","with open('source.txt', 'w') as src:\n","    src.write(\"This is the content of source.txt\")\n","\n","# Q4: Copy content from one file to another\n","with open('source.txt', 'r') as src, open('destination.txt', 'w') as dest:\n","    dest.write(src.read())\n","\n","# Q5: Handle division by zero error\n","try:\n","    result = 10 / 0\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n","\n","# Q6: Log division by zero error\n","import logging\n","\n","logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.ERROR)\n","\n","try:\n","    result = 10 / 0\n","except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n","    logging.error(\"Attempted division by zero: %s\", e)\n","\n","# Q7: Log messages at different levels\n","import logging\n","\n","logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.DEBUG)\n","\n","logging.debug(\"This is a debug message.\")\n","logging.info(\"This is an info message.\")\n","logging.warning(\"This is a warning message.\")\n","logging.error(\"This is an error message.\")\n","logging.critical(\"This is a critical message.\")\n","\n","# Q8: Handle file opening error\n","try:\n","    with open('non_existent_file.txt', 'r') as file:\n","        content = file.read()\n","except IOError as e:\n","    print(f\"File opening error: {e}\")\n","\n","# Q9: Read file line by line into a list\n","with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n","    lines = file.readlines()\n","print(lines)\n","\n","# Q10: Append data to a file\n","with open('example.txt', 'a') as file:\n","    file.write(\"\\nThis is an appended line.\")\n","\n","# Q11: Handle KeyError in dictionary access\n","my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}\n","\n","try:\n","    print(my_dict['address'])\n","except KeyError:\n","    print(\"Key not found in dictionary.\")\n","\n","# Q12: Multiple except blocks\n","try:\n","    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n","    result = 10 / num\n","except ValueError:\n","    print(\"Invalid input.
